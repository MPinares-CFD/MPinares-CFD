👋 Hi, I’m MPinares-CFD!

I'm a PhD student in Applied CFD and Hypersonics at Mississippi State University, and I also work full-time as an Aerospace Systems Engineer focusing on Fluid and Thermal Analysis in the commercial space industry. 

🔬 **PhD Research:**  
I use a mix of OpenFOAM, MATLAB, flowPsi, and Python for my research, plus FreeCAD with CfdOF for geometry and meshing tasks.

🚀 **Professional Life:**  
At work, I spend most of my time with Thermal Desktop, MATLAB, and the occasional FORTRAN code (yes, it still lives!). 

💻 **Hobby Projects:**  
For fun (and general curiosity), I'm learning more Python and C++—mostly to get better at CFD coding and data post-processing.

🌟 **GitHub Beginner:**  
I'm still pretty new to GitHub, so I'm slowly figuring out how everything works. So far, I’ve pulled down results from the CFD Workshop and HiSA (for high-speed OpenFOAM simulations).

🛠️ **Always Learning:**  
I've been in the aerospace industry for over 15 years and in grad school (very) part-time for over a decade. There's always something new to learn, and I’m here for it!

Feel free to connect, share ideas, or just say hi!
